Add and reorder tabs in AffiliateWP's new Affiliate Portal pro add-on.

== Description ==

> This plugin requires [AffiliateWP](https://affiliatewp.com/ "AffiliateWP") and the [AffiliateWP - Affiliate Portal](https://affiliatewp.com/add-ons/pro/affiliate-portal "AffiliateWP - Affiliate Portal") pro add-on in order to function.

Affiliate Portal Tabs allows you to manage built-in and custom tabs in the Affiliate Portal. Each custom tab can be externally linked to a WordPress page.

Note: The site admin will need to manage affiliate access for custom tabs linking to external pages.

Affiliate Portal Tabs allows you to:

1. Add new custom tabs to your Affiliate Portal linking to external pages
2. Reorder any tab via drag and drop
3. Hide built-in tabs from appearing in the Affiliate Portal
4. Manage tabs added by other AffiliateWP add-ons (Direct Link Tracking, Show Affiliate Coupons, Order Details For Affiliates, etc.)
